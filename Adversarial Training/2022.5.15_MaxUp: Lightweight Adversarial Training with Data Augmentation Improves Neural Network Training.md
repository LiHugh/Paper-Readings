## Idea: 
To improve the generalization performance of DNNs by generating a set of augmented data with some random perturbations or transforms, and minimize the maximum,
or worst case loss over the augmented data. Maxup can leverage arbitrary state-of-the-art data augmentation schemes, and substrantially improves over them without adding significang 
computational ahead.

## Method:
