# [Adversarial Defense via Learning to Generate Diverse Attacks](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCV_2019/papers/Jang_Adversarial_Defense_via_Learning_to_Generate_Diverse_Attacks_ICCV_2019_paper.pdf)
## key ideas:
- utilize the generator to learn how to create adversarial examples. Learning-to-learn framework.
## Methods:
- propose a recursive and stochastic generotr that produces much stronger and diverse perturbations that comprehensively reveal the vulnerability of the target classifer.

## Some details:
- regularize the generator to promote diversity in perturbations. to prevent the adversarial training from overfitting to specific attacks and to stablize the generator training.
