# [Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning with Imagined Subgoals](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.00541.pdf)
Unlike the paper "[C-PLANNING: AN AUTOMATIC CURRICULUM
FOR LEARNING GOAL-REACHING TASKS
](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=K2JfSnLBD9)" where the author uses planning to modify the data, this paper modifies the objective. In this work, the author proposes to use subgoals to improve the
goal-conditioned policy.
