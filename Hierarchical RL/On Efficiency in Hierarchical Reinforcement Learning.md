# [On Efficiency in Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2020/file/4a5cfa9281924139db466a8a19291aff-Paper.pdf)

hierarchical rl has several benefits: 1) more effecient exploration, by helping an agent circulate more efficiently over the state space; 2) more efficient assignment,
because temporally extended models propagate credit over many time steps; 3) the ability to solve smaller problems and compose the resulting policies and models quickly
in new situations.
